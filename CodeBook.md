## Code Book

This document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work 
that was perfomred on the input datafiles related to 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones' provided as part of the assignment and to arrive at the output file 'tidydata.txt'


Following are the variables of file tidydata.txt

 [1] "subject": Unique identifier for all the 30 subjects performing activities of daily living
      1....30
      
 [2] "activity": activities perfomed by the subjects with below listed 6 levels
        WALKING
        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        SITTING
        STANDING
        LAYING
      
Following are the list of all the variables holding average data based on grouping for each subject and each activity.
